#  our first exercise

#  operators
#  addition(+),subtraction(-),multiplication(*),division(/),modulo(reminder(%)),floar division(GIF(//)) and exponential(**)

#   CREATE A CALCULATOR WHICH PEROFRM ADDITION SUBTRACTION MULTIPLICATIO AND DIVISION OF TWO NUMBERS

a = 50
b = 40
print('THE ADDITION OF TWO NUMBER IS : ',a + b)
print('THE SUBTRACTION OF TWO NUMBER IS : ',a - b)
print('THE MULTIPLICATION OF TWO NUMBER IS : ',a * b)
print('THE DIVISION OF TWO NUMBER IS : ',a / b)
print('THE FLOAR DIVISION OF TWO NUMBER IS : ',a // b)
print('THE EXPONENTIAL OF TWO NUMBER IS : ',a ** b)
print('THE REMAINDER OF TWO NUMBER IS : ',a % b)

# #   SECOND METHOD 

a = 50
b = 40
print("THE ADDTION OF",a,"+",b,"is :",a + b)
print("THE SUBTRACTION OF",a,"-",b,"is :",a - b)
print("THE MULTIPLICATION OF",a,"*",b,"is :",a * b)
print("THE DIVISION OF",a,"/",b,"is :",a / b)
print("THE FLOAR DIVISION OF",a,"//",b,"is :",a // b)
print("THE EXPONENTIAL OF",a,"a^b",b,"is :",a ** b)
print("THE REMAINDER OF",a,"%",b,"is :",a % b)
